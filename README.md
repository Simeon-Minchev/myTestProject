myTestProject

The project is separated in two parts - myTestServerAPI and myTestProject

myTestServerAPI

This project contains the server API for saving, downloading and deleting files. It requires a MongoDB to be installed on the machine with default settings. Before starting the server install the node modules.

myTestProject

This project contains the web app. Since this is an Ionic project it can be run with the command "ionic serve".
